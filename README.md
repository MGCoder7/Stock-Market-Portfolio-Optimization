# Stock-Market-Portfolio-Optimization
Stock market portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best combination of stocks to maximize returns while minimizing the risk, based on historical performance data and financial metrics.

This project involves analyzing price trends, calculating expected returns and volatilities, and determining the correlations between different stocks to achieve diversification. 

Using techniques such as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), I had constructed an efficient portfolio that relies on the efficient frontier to represent the optimal trade-off between risk and return.

The expected results from stock market portfolio optimization include identifying the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio, which indicates the best risk-adjusted return and provides a clear allocation strategy for the selected stocks to achieve long-term investment goals.
